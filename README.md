# Bangladesh Natural Resource Simulation (2025-2035)

This project provides a Python-based simulation framework to model the complex dynamics of natural resource management in Bangladesh over the period 2025-2035.

## Overview

The simulation integrates multiple interconnected components representing key natural resource systems and influencing factors:

*   Water Resources
*   Land & Soil Systems
*   Forest & Tree Resources
*   Biodiversity & Ecosystems
*   Mineral & Extractive Resources
*   Energy Resources & Transition
*   Marine & Coastal Resources
*   Climate Change & Resilience
*   Resource Governance & Policy
*   Community-Based Management
*   Sustainable Utilization & Development
*   Conservation & Restoration

It aims to project resource sustainability, ecosystem health, utilization patterns, and management effectiveness under various potential scenarios.

## Structure

*   `/bangladesh_natural_resource_simulation`: Main package directory.
    *   `__init__.py`: Package initializer.
    *   `/models`: Contains individual Python classes for each resource component model.
        *   `water_resource.py`, `land_resource.py`, ... etc.
    *   `/data`: Contains data handling logic (currently placeholder).
        *   `handler.py`: `NaturalResourceDataHandler` class.
    *   `/analysis`: Contains analysis and visualization logic.
        *   `engine.py`: `NaturalResourceAnalysisEngine` class.
    *   `simulation.py`: The main `BangladeshNaturalResourceSimulation` class orchestrating the models.
    *   `config.py`: Configuration settings for the simulation (years, scenarios, parameters).
    *   `main.py`: The main executable script to run the simulation and analysis.
*   `/outputs`: Default directory for simulation results, visualizations, and reports.
    *   `/visualizations`: Contains generated plots.
    *   `report.html`: HTML summary report.
    *   `simulation_results_[ScenarioName].json`: Raw simulation output.
*   `README.md`: This file.
*   `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure the simulation (optional):**
    *   Edit `bangladesh_natural_resource_simulation/config.py` to change years, select scenarios, or adjust placeholder parameters.
5.  **Run the simulation:**
    ```bash
    python -m bangladesh_natural_resource_simulation.main
    ```
    Or simply:
    ```bash
    python bangladesh_natural_resource_simulation/main.py 
    ```

6.  **Check the outputs:**
    *   Review the console output for simulation progress.
    *   Examine the generated files in the `outputs/` directory, including `report.html` and plots in `outputs/visualizations/`.

## Current Status

*   **Core Structure:** The main simulation framework, model classes, analysis engine, and configuration are set up.
*   **Models:** Model classes are defined based on the prompt, with `__init__` methods, placeholder data loading (`_load_*`), and simulation step methods (`simulate_*_dynamics`).
*   **Synthetic Data:** Initial plausible synthetic data has been added to the `_load_*` methods for demonstration.
*   **Simulation Logic:** The main simulation loop in `simulation.py` calls each model's step function sequentially.
*   **Analysis:** Basic analysis generates summary metrics (mostly placeholders), creates placeholder plots using Matplotlib, and produces a simple HTML report.
*   **Data Handling:** `NaturalResourceDataHandler` is a placeholder; actual data loading from external files/APIs is not implemented.
*   **Model Interdependencies:** Interactions between models within a timestep are currently minimal (state dictionary is passed but models mostly operate independently based on initial data).

## Future Development

*   Implement actual data loading in `NaturalResourceDataHandler` using real Bangladesh data sources (CSV, Shapefiles, APIs).
*   Develop detailed simulation logic within each model's `simulate_*_dynamics` method, incorporating data and interactions.
*   Refine model interdependencies (e.g., land use change affecting water quality, climate impacting crop yields).
*   Implement advanced modeling techniques (Agent-Based Modeling, System Dynamics, Geospatial analysis) as outlined in the prompt.
*   Enhance the `NaturalResourceAnalysisEngine` with more sophisticated metrics, statistical analysis, and visualizations (e.g., using Plotly/Dash for interactive dashboards).
*   Develop scenario management capabilities to easily run and compare different policy or climate scenarios.
